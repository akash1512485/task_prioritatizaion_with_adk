# Task Prioritization AI App

A web application that leverages Google Vertex AI (Gemini) to intelligently prioritize your tasks based on urgency, importance, effort, deadlines, and context (like company OKRs). Built with FastAPI for the backend and a simple HTML frontend, and fully containerized with Docker.

---

## Features
- **AI-powered task prioritization** using Google Vertex AI (Gemini)
- **Supports task deadlines** in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-07-12T23:59:00`)
- **REST API** for programmatic access
- **User-friendly web frontend** for easy task entry and results viewing
- **Dockerized** for easy deployment anywhere

---

## File Overview

- **agent_prioritazion.py**: Main FastAPI backend. Handles API requests, serves the frontend, and communicates with Vertex AI.
- **frontend.html**: Simple HTML/JS frontend for user interaction.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **Dockerfile**: Containerizes the app for deployment.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Google Cloud Setup
- Enable the **Vertex AI API** in your Google Cloud project.
- Create a **Service Account** with Vertex AI permissions and download the JSON key, or use `gcloud auth application-default login` to generate `application_default_credentials.json`.
- Note the path to your credentials file (e.g., `C:/Users/yourname/AppData/Roaming/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`).

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone this repo and cd into it
cd /path/to/task_prioritization
```

### 3. Local Development

#### a. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### b. Set Google Credentials

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json"
```

**Command Prompt:**

```cmd
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json
```

#### c. Set Vertex AI Project and Location

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1
```

#### d. Run the app

```bash
python agent_prioritazion.py
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

### 4. Docker Deployment

#### a. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t task-prioritization-app .
```

#### b. Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id \
  -e VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1 \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/application_default_credentials.json \
  -v C:/Users/yourname/AppData/Roaming/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/app/application_default_credentials.json \
  task-prioritization-app
```

## API Usage Example

**POST /prioritize**

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    "Finish the Q2 sales report by tomorrow",
    "Book a flight for the conference in Austin next month"
  ],
  "context": "Q2 Company OKRs: Launch Project Phoenix, Achieve 15% sales growth"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "prioritized_tasks": [
    {
      "task_description": "Finish the Q2 sales report by tomorrow",
      "priority_level": "Critical",
      "estimated_effort": "High",
      "reasoning": "Deadline is imminent and it's crucial for company OKRs.",
      "deadline": "2025-07-12T23:59:00"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Authentication errors:** Ensure your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env variable is set and the file is accessible in the container or local environment.
* **Vertex AI errors:** Make sure the API is enabled and your service account has the right permissions.
* **Port conflicts:** Change the exposed port in the Dockerfile and run command if 8000 is in use.
